# Brio Track Designs

A few years ago a relative of ours very generously bought my (then) 3 year-old
daughter a Brio railway set (specifically the [33097 Cargo Railway Deluxe
Set][brio-set]). Over the last few years we've made up quite a few different
layouts with it and (occasionally!) remembered to take the odd picture before
dismantling it so we might stand a chance of rebuilding it again.

However, easy as pictures are, they're not the ideal for documenting track
layouts. Being semi-capable with [Inkscape][inkscape] I eventually decided it
was about time I put together an SVG I could use to easily sketch a track
layout in a nice, clean, printable format.

This repository is the result! The contents are as follows:

* `template.svg` -- this SVG may appear blank in preview but has all the pieces
  from the set we've got arranged around the outside of the "paper" and is my
  starting point for sketching a new track.

* `map1.svg` -- a recreation of the original design that came with the set (our
  original paper instructions disintegrated years ago!).

* `map2.svg` -- a design with two overlapping loops, one in a figure of eight
  passing over and under the bridge.

* `map3.svg` -- another design with two loops, and another figure of eight
  passing over and under the bridge.

* `map4.svg` -- quite a large two loop design with a tiny spur (because that's
  all the track we had left!)

You may note that on all our designs there's a certain "fudge factor". Brio's
quite forgiving about pieces not fitting quite perfectly. Each of the designs
here **has** been built successfully: we don't design stuff in Inkscape, then
built it. Typically we play around building stuff first, then I quickly
transcribe the design into Inkscape from the template, wonder how on earth it
works in real-life given how far off the pieces inevitably wind up from
"perfectly" fitting, fudge it around a bit until it sort of fits, then print
that :)

  the time of writing, but hopefully that's temporary!)

## Contributions Welcome

Please feel free to fork this repository and make your own designs. I'd be
happy to add to the available layouts (and potentially the templates if people
want to derive / add templates for other kits). We may have to think about some
better file naming conventions at some point, but I'm happy to make that a
"future problem" for now!
